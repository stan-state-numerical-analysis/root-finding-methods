# Task: Implement Newton's Root-Finding Method in Python.

# 1. Define a function called newtons_method that takes the following parameters:
#    - f: The function whose root is to be found.
#    - f_prime: The derivative of the function f.
#    - x0: The initial guess for the root.
#    - tol: The tolerance for the difference between successive approximations.
#    - max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations to perform.



  # 2. Inside the newtons_method function, initialize a variable called x_n with the value of x0.



  # 3. Create a for loop that does max_iterations number of steps.



    # 5. For each step in the loop, compute the next approximation x_n+1 using the Newton's method formula.



    # 6. Check if the absolute difference between x_n+1 and x_n is less than the specified tolerance.
    #    If so, return x_n+1.



    # 7. If the tolerance condition is not met, update x_n to x_n+1 for the next iteration.



  # 8. If the maximum number of iterations is reached without a return, print a message
  #    saying "Maximum number of iterations reached" and return the last computed value of x_n.
