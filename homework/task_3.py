# Task: Apply Newton's Method to find extreme values and visualize the output.

# 1. Import the matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, the newtons_method function from the task_1.py file, and the central_difference
# function from the task_2.py file.



# 2. Define a new function called plot_extreme_value that applies Newton's method to find an extreme value
#    of any function and plots the results.
#    - Parameters:
#      - f: The function whose derivative is being analyzed.
#      - x_interval: A tuple specifying the interval of x values containing the extreme value.



  # 3. Copy and paste the code from plot_newtons_method from the task_2.py file and make the necessary
  # changes to find and plot an extreme value of f on the interval x_interval (and plots f itself).
  # Make the title of the plot: f"Approximation of an Extreme Value of f(x) in [{x_values[0]}, {x_values[1]}]"
